# Bubble Sort on Linked List Implementation in C++

This project implements the Bubble Sort algorithm on a linked list in C++. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through the linked list, compares adjacent nodes, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until the linked list is sorted.

## Features


- Implementation of Bubble Sort on a linked list in C++
- Simple sorting algorithm suitable for smaller linked lists
- Iteratively sorts the linked list in place using adjacent node swaps


## Requirements

- C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    

2. Change to the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd main-cpp
    ```
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
  

## Time Complexity and Space

<b>Bubble Sort:</b>  The average and worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort on a linked list is <b>O(n^2)</b>, where `n` is the size of the linked list. The best-case time complexity is <b>O(n)</b> if the list is already sorted.


<b>Space complexity</b> Bubble Sort on a linked list sorts the list in place and does not require additional data structures. Therefore, the space complexity is <b>O(1)</b>.

## Usage

- The program initializes a linked list by reading integer inputs from the user.
- It then displays the linked list before sorting, sorts the linked list using Bubble Sort, and then displays the list again after sorting.
- Modify the input data in the program to test different scenarios as desired.

## Functions

The Bubble Sort implementation on a linked list contains the following key functions:

- `printList`: Prints the elements of the linked list.
- `sortList`: Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm on the linked list, iterating through the list and swapping adjacent nodes if they are in the wrong order.
