# Bubble Sort Implementation in C++

<p>This project implements the Bubble Sort algorithm on an array in C++. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until the array is sorted.</p>

## Features


- Implementation of Bubble Sort on an array in C++
- Simple sorting algorithm suitable for smaller arrays
- Iteratively sorts the array in place using adjacent element swaps


## Requirements

- C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    

2. Change to the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd main-cpp
    ```
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
  

## Time Complexity and Space

<b>Bubble Sort: </b>  The average and worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort is <b>O(n^2)</b>, where n is the size of the array. The best-case time complexity is <b>O(n)</b> if the array is already sorted.

<b>Space Complexity: O(1)</b> Bubble Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it sorts the array without requiring additional data structures. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).



## Usage

- The program initializes an array with the provided data.
- It displays the array before sorting, sorts the array using Bubble Sort, and then displays the array after sorting.
- Modify the data in the program to test different scenarios as desired.


## Functions

The Bubble Sort implementation contains the following key functions:

- `swap`: Swaps the values of two integer variables.
- `bubbleSort`: Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm, iterating through the array and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- `display`: Prints the elements of the array.
