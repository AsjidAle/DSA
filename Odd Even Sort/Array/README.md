# Odd-Even Sort Implementation in C++

This project demonstrates the implementation of Odd-Even Sort in C++. Odd-even sort is a parallel sorting algorithm that works by comparing all pairs of adjacent elements in the array and swapping them if they are in the wrong order, alternating between odd and even indexes.

## Features

- Sorts elements of an array using the Odd-Even Sort algorithm.
- Demonstrates the Odd-Even Sort algorithm step by step.
- Displays the original and sorted array elements.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang

## Getting Started

1. Copy the provided code into a C++ source file (e.g., `odd_even_sort.cpp`).

2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:

    ```shell
    g++ -o odd_even_sort odd_even_sort.cpp
    ```

3. Run the compiled executable:

    ```shell
    ./odd_even_sort
    ```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of Odd-Even Sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.

## Space Complexity

- The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), as it only requires a constant amount of extra space for variables.

## Usage

- The program initializes an array with unsorted elements.
- It displays the original array elements.
- The oddEvenSort function sorts the array elements using the Odd-Even Sort algorithm.
- It displays the sorted array elements.

## Functions

The code contains the following key functions:

- `oddEvenSort`: Implements the Odd-Even Sort algorithm to sort the array.
- `printArray`: Prints the elements of the array.
