# Shell Sort Implementation in C++

This code demonstrates the implementation of Shell sort in C++. Shell sort is an efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that improves upon insertion sort by sorting distant elements first, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. Here's a breakdown of the code:

## Features


- Efficiently sorts an array of integers using comb sort.
- Demonstrates the comb sort algorithm step by step.
- Displays the original and sorted array elements.


## Requirements

- C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    

2. Change to the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd main-cpp
    ```
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
  

## Time Complexity and Space

<b>Time Complexity</b>: The time complexity of Shell sort depends on the chosen sequence of increments. The worst-case time complexity is typically considered as `O(n^2)`, but it can perform better with certain gap sequences, achieving a time complexity closer to `O(n log n)`.
<b>Space Complexity: </b>
Space Complexity: The space complexity of the algorithm is `O(1)`, as it only requires a constant amount of extra space for variables.



## Usage

- The program initializes an array with unsorted elements.
- It displays the original array elements.
- The `ShellSort` function sorts the array elements using the Shell sort algorithm.
- It displays the sorted array elements.

## Functions

The implementation contains the following key functions:

- `ShellSort`: Implements the Shell sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
